<h2>Hidden array</h2>
<p>Given two arrays of integers. The first one is the following:</p>

<pre><code class="java">[ 8, 19, 12, 7, 6, 5 ]</code></pre>

<p>We donâ€™t know neither the size nor the values of the second array. However, we have searched for every value of the first array in the second array using linear search. We've established that the numbers 19, 6, and 5 from it are present in the second array.</p>

<p><br>
What is the minimum number of comparison operations required to perform the entire algorithm of searching for the numbers of the first array in the second one? Note that the information that we have about the second array is enough to calculate the answer.</p>
